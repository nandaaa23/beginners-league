# Simon Says

---

## What I Learned

- How to divide a circle into four clickable quarters using border-radius and positioning
- How to turn that into a donut with a hole in the middle
- How to write the game logic: flashing panels, delays, and checking player input step-by-step

---

## Favorite Part

Definitely the flashing logic. Watching the pattern light up and timing everything just right felt really cool to get working.

## What I'd Add If I Had More Time

- The "Simon Says" text narrating the move to make
- Sound effects when panels light up or get clicked
- Maybe a score counter

## How to Play

1. Hover over the center to see the pattern
2. Remember the sequence
3. Click the panels in the same order
4. If you're right — yay. If not — try again
